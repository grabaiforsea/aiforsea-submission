# aiforsea-submission

Welcome to my humble submission! As requested, I will focus on *creativity*, though might not be the creativity in the sense that you prefer ;)

To make this work, make a folder in the parent directory named data, then another folder inside it named raw, then put the training.csv file inside (Github doesn't allow uploading big files!). The aptly named IPython notebook in src directory contains all the mess I've made. Hope you enjoy checking my work!
